# Real-Time-Vision-Pipeline-for-Autonomous-Navigation-on-Raspberry-Pi-using-Classical-Image-Processing
Real-time vision pipeline on Raspberry Pi using HSV thresholding and custom morphology to isolate drivable areas, dilation-based edge detection and contour filtering for obstacle detection, simple stop/slow/turn logic at ~5 FPS, with annotated frames streamed over TCP.
